* Would be nice:
	- when going through and categorizing, I can add new rule - and specify if it is regex, etc. etc.
	- also need to have a list of rules (would be nice if I have a list of unused rules to remove old stuff)
	- would be nice to have drop down, when choosing category, and autocomplete if choose to type
	- add a log file that the software creates and prints. I can use this later to know what happened.
	    - notes should go here. Final transfers should go here.
	- would also be nice to have a list of todos, for each payment cycle. That I can check off as I go.
	- add a place to write notes about what was done each session. So that I can go back and remember more easily.
	- Eventually have an automated way to create a data handler: given a particular csv, specify how to match linear
	    combination of fields, to desired field. Might also need some format specifiers.!!! (make is useful to others;
	     will need interfaces and abstract classes)



Old notes
* Main thing - must be easy to add, change or remove rules
* must also have an easy way to add and remove categories
	- maybe easy way to reprocess?
* it would be cool if it could read categories, notes from csv (the one that melissa returns to me)
* it would be awesome if I could auto download API
	- if not, at least open files, identify which is which (without me having to rename them)
* minimize number of inputs:


Rule Types:
    * exact match
    * exact contain
    * case insensitive versions of the above two
    * regex match

* Allow rule batches to be applied. This will allow for refinements. (Should note when a change occurs).
