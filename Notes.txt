* Would be nice:
	- when going through and categorizing, I can add new rule - and specify if it is regex, etc. etc.
	- also need to have a list of rules (would be nice if I have a list of unused rules to remove old stuff)
	- would be nice to have drop down, when choosing category, and autocomplete if choose to type
	- would also be nice to have a list of todos, for each payment cycle. That I can check off as I go.



Old notes
* Main thing - must be easy to add, change or remove rules
* must also have an easy way to add and remove categories
	- maybe easy way to reprocess?
* it woudl be cool if it could read categories, notes from csv (the one that melissa returns to me)
* it would be awesome if I could auto download API
	- if not, at least open files, identify which is which (without me having to rename them)
* minimize number of inputs:
